 * TODO (Part C): Describe addSession(minutes), including its result when the log cannot accept another session.
 * Adds one study session duration in minutes when space remains; returns whether it was added.
 * TODO (Part C): Describe totalMinutes().
 * Returns the total number of minutes stored in the log.
 * TODO (Part C): Describe longestSession() and its precondition.
 *  Returns the longest study session duration stored in the log; precondition: the log is not empty.
 * TODO (Part C): Describe size() and isEmpty().
 * Returns the number of stored study session durations; reports whether no durations are stored.
